1.1.0 (14 Sep 2008)
===================

 - Fix a compiler error on some systems (bug 1822).
 - Fix incorrect getaddrinfo() usage breaking use on NetBSD (bug 3767).
 - Fix possible hang when reading IMAP responses when a selected folder
   is later deleted or unsubscribed.
 - Fix buffer size issues when reading IMAP folder contents (bug 2009).
 - Fix mailcheck interval not getting saved if changed using the
   keyboard rather than the mouse (bug 2386).
 - Fix problems receiving full commands on IMAP accounts (bug 2416).
 - Fix problems receiving full commands on POP3 accounts (bug 2013).
 - Fix removed new-mail folders sometimes re-adding themselves (bug 2647).

 - Display message in log about possible incorrect username/password
   when IMAP or POP3 authentication fails (bug 4344).
 - Clean out stale mailbox data when a mailbox is removed.
 - Update the new message counts for all mailboxes on startup, rather than
   waiting for the first interval timeout.
 - Document the behavior of forcing a new messsage count update when the
   user double-clicks the icon (patch from Maximilian Schleiss).
 - Add experimental IPv6 support.
 - Add an 'Update Now' menu item (bug 3908).
 - Add CRAM-MD5 authentication support for POP3 and IMAP (bug 3420).
 - Add about dialog.
 - Network layer heavily refactored to make code more readable and fix
   strange timing bugs.  It's much easier to read, maintain, and debug
   now.  This isn't particularly user-visible, but is notable.
 - Eliminated periodic wakeups to see if it's time to check mail again,
   instead using a long-running timeout.  A side-effect of this is that
   the mail-checking threads no longer run all the time, but only when
   needed.  Should save a little battery life for laptop users, and
   just be more resource-friendly in general.
 - Allow non-square plugin buttons.
 - Allow deselecting INBOX in the IMAP folder list (bug 4150).
 - Use GtkFileChooserButton for mbox and maildir file/dir entries rather
   than a GtkEntry+GtkButton.


1.0.1 (20 Apr 2006)
===================

 - Fix a possible connection failure when using IMAPS or POP3S.
 - Don't compile in the GMail mailbox type if GNUTLS is not available,
   as GMail requires an SSL HTTP connection.


1.0.0 (31 Jan 2006)
===================

 - Initial release. I feel pretty good about it, thus the 1.0.0 designation.
   That means there are no bugs. Seriously. Ok, not really.
