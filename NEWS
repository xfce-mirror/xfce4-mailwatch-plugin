Version 1.1.0svn:

  Bugfixes:
    * Fix a compiler error on some systems (bug 1822).
    * Fix incorrect getaddrinfo() usage breaking use on NetBSD (bug 3767).
    * Fix possible hang when reading IMAP responses when a selected folder
      is later deleted or unsubscribed.
    * Fix buffer size issues when reading IMAP folder contents (bug 2009).
    * Fix mailcheck interval not getting saved if changed using the
      keyboard rather than the mouse (bug 2386).
    * Fix problems receiving full commands on IMAP accounts (bug 2416).
    * Fix problems receiving full commands on POP3 accounts (bug 2013).

  Features:
    * Update the new message counts for all mailboxes on startup, rather than
      waiting for the first interval timeout.
    * Document the behavior of forcing a new messsage count update when the
      user double-clicks the icon (patch from Maximilian Schleiss).
    * Add experimental IPv6 support.
    * Add an 'Update Now' menu item (bug 3908).
    * Add CRAM-MD5 authentication support for POP3 and IMAP (bug 3420).
    * Add about dialog.
    * Network layer heavily refactored to make code more readable and fix
      strange timing bugs.  It's much easier to read, maintain, and debug
      now.  This isn't particularly user-visible, but is notable.
    * Eliminated periodic wakeups to see if it's time to check mail again,
      instead using a long-running timeout.  A side-effect of this is that
      the mail-checking threads no longer run all the time, but only when
      needed.  Should save a little battery life for laptop users, and
      just be more resource-friendly in general.
    * Allow non-square plugin buttons.
    * Allow deselecting INBOX in the IMAP folder list (bug 4150).


Version 1.0.1 (20 Apr 2006):

  Bugfixes:
    * Fix a possible connection failure when using IMAPS or POP3S.
    * Don't compile in the GMail mailbox type if GNUTLS is not available,
      as GMail requires an SSL HTTP connection.


Version 1.0.0 (31 Jan 2006):

  Initial release.  I feel pretty good about it, thus the 1.0.0
  designation.  That means there are no bugs.  Seriously.  Ok, not
  really.
