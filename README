| Xfce4 Mailwatch Plugin |
+------------------------+

The Xfce4 Mailwatch Plugin is a multi-protocol, multi-mailbox mail watcher.
Currently, the protocols supported are:

  * IMAP (SSL/TLS and cleartext, CRAM-MD5)
  * POP3 (SSL/TLS and cleartext, CRAM-MD5)
  * Mbox mail spool (local)
  * Maildir mail spool (local)
  * MH-Maildir mail spool (local)
  * Google Mail (GMail) mailbox (remote) (requires gnutls)

Random list of features:

  * Multiple folder checking support for IMAP.
  * Independent check intervals for each mailbox.
  * Threaded design; xfce4-panel UI should never freeze or block.
  * Informative button tooltip that tells you the number of new messages in
    each mailbox.
  * Optionally run a command when new mail arrives, or when the panel button
    is clicked.
  * Error log accessible from the plugin properties dialog, with a small
    overlay icon to inform the user of errors at a glance.
  * Custom button icons.

gnutls 1.2.0 or greater is optional, but required for SSL/TLS support. GMail
requires this support. Sending cleartext passwords across unsecured networks
is not recommended. This plugin should work with any Xfce version from 4.8.0
onwards.
